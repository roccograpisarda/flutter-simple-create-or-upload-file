- File upload and creation: Users can upload existing files or create new files directly from the app. The app provides a file manager interface where users can browse through their device's files and folders.

- Storage permission request: this app includes a method that requests storage permission for all Android versions. This ensures that users can access their files without any permission issues.

-  User-friendly interface: The app's interface is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. Users can quickly upload or create files with just a few taps.
